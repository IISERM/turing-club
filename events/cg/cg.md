# Code Golf
A code golf is a recreational programming contest where participants have to solve a programming problem using either the shortest possible source code or the fastest possible one, depending upon the problem. The basic motivation behind code golf is to solve simple problems and have fun while learning the often looked over nuances of a programming language. Unlike a hackathon, code golf doesn't require you to solve a lengthy and complicated problem which requires hours of coding. Furthermore, code golf is an excellent way of honing your programming skills if you are new to a language since you can learn a lot from the solutions of other participants.


Here are the rules of the event-

1. Every week, we would send a basic question and specify whether you have to submit the shortest or the fastest solution to it.
2. The difficulty would increase every week(don't worry, we won't get to the level of hackathons).
3. The solutions are expected to be written in python and submitted in a text file via a google form.
4. The winners would be announced in 3 categories- MS21, MS20 and (MS19, MS18, MS17, IntPhDs and PhDs combined). We will maintain 3 leaderboards and at the end of the semester, we will announce a winner from each of the 3 categories.
